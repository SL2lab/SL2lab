- 👋 Hi, We're @SL2lab, the computational team for the Sensors for Living Systems lab lead by David Myers, PhD, based at Georgia Tech and Emory University in Atlanta, GA
- 👀 We're interested in quantitatively measuring how cells function to enable better healthcare
- 🌱 We're currently learning coding methods for data analysis for everything ranging from DNA sensors to TikTok outreach
- 💞️ We're looking to collaborate on new ways to take accurate measurements of patient vital signs and learning how to extract information from biological systems
- 📫 Submit a pull request or reach our computational team at Myers.SL2.lab@gmail.com
